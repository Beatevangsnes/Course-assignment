    <p id="web-security-question">
      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words
    </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
      [I would reccomend to use HTTPS. HTTPS stands for HyperText Transfer
      Protocol Secure. With HTTPS the communication between the server and the
      client is encrypted using either TLS or SSL. Using HTTPS protects your
      website from attacks, and if a clients input data on your website, the
      data can be secureley sent.]
